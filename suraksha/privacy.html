    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Last updated: July 30, 2025</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>Your privacy and security are the foundation of Suraksha. This policy outlines how we handle and protect your information.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Reporting Data:</strong> When you submit a report without creating an account, the information is treated as anonymous. We do not collect IP addresses or browser fingerprints associated with the report.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address and name. This allows you to track your report's status and communicate securely with counselors.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Logs:</strong> All messages between you and a counselor via our platform are encrypted and stored securely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To connect you with verified partner NGOs and counselors who can provide support.</li>
            <li>To allow you to track the status of your case via your secure dashboard.</li>
            <li>To generate anonymized, aggregated statistics to understand the scope of the problem and measure our impact (e.g., total reports, types of incidents). Your personal data is never used for this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS) for all data transmission. Our databases are secured, and access is strictly limited to key personnel and the specific support professional assigned to your case.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We will **never** sell your data. The details of your report are shared only with the verified partner organization assigned to help you. We will not disclose your information to law enforcement unless legally compelled to do so by a court order.</p>
