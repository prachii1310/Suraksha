          <div class="post-content">
              <p>For survivors of abuse, the fear of retaliation or judgment can be a significant barrier to seeking help. This is where the power of anonymous reporting becomes a critical tool for empowerment and safety.</p>
              <p>By removing the requirement of identity, we allow individuals to share their story and seek initial help without immediate risk. It is the first, crucial step on a long road to recovery, and at Suraksha, we are committed to making that first step as safe as possible.</p>
