    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Providing a secure and anonymous platform for reporting abuse and finding support.</p>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>Suraksha was founded on the principle that everyone has the right to safety and a voice. We understand that reporting abuse can be an incredibly difficult and intimidating step. Our mission is to remove these barriers by providing a platform that is completely confidential, secure, and supportive.</p>
      <p>We are a collective of developers, counselors, and volunteers based in Jansla, Punjab, dedicated to leveraging technology to create safer communities. Every report filed is handled with the utmost care and is directed to verified support personnel and NGOs who can provide real-world assistance.</p>
